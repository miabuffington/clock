# clock
This assignment was to create a new version of a clock. I have to admit, I was stumped in the beginning of this project on what direction to go. I could not think of any creative approaches to a clock that hadn't already been thought of. After a while of thinking, I decided to use a more basic version of a clock that our professor had shown us as a foundation, and add changes to give it a story and personal touch. My clock has colors that represent an alarm clock from my childhood and there is a lot of sentimental meaning behind it. I moved around a lot as a kid, and it was really difficult to move from place to place all the time. However, I remember having this small blue and red alarm clock that my grandma gave me, and I brought it from house to house, as a sense of normalcy. Even though I am much older now, and smart phones are used as alarm clocks now, I still have the alarm clock back at my parents house. I used the red and blue from that memory to give my basic clock coding more meaning, so that when I look at it, I am instantly reminded of simpler times.
